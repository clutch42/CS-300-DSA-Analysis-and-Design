# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that we were trying to solve was what data structure would be a better fit for a list of courses that included the number, description, and prerequisites. I wouldn't exactly call it a problem, more of determining which one was a better fit and had better run time and memory for the project.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The approach that I used was to learn more about vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees and really get into how the insert and search functions on them work. This led to a much better understanding of ideal and worst case senarios for both of those functions.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I won't lie. I had a ton of errors pop up while coding the solution, but I just followed pretty standard debugging solutions to work through them. My favorite is using print statements to print variable values or conditional values to make sure the code was working properly up to that point. For understanding the actual data structures though, I didn't really have any problems. I have used vectors before, but never hash tables or binary search trees, and I really enjoyed using them and feel like I have a pretty strong knowledge of how to use them now.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As they say, practice makes perfect. I wouldn't say that I really changed anything about the way I write programs, but am tuning it and becoming a better programmer. Another thing that I used in this project that helped immensely was ChatGPT to create data to use for testing. Instead of wasting time writing csv files, I got to tinker with my code more, and try out way more variety on catching errors in input.
