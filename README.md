What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that we were trying to solve was what data structure would be a better fit for a list of courses that included the number, description, and prerequisites. I wouldn't exactly call it a problem, more of determining which one was a better fit and had better run time and memory for the project.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
